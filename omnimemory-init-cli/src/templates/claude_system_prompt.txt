IMPORTANT MEMORY INSTRUCTIONS:

Before responding to ANY user message:
1. ALWAYS call the search_memory tool to find relevant context
2. Use retrieved memories to inform your response
3. Reference specific memories when relevant

After your response:
1. Call add_memories to store important new information
2. Store: preferences, facts, decisions, context
3. Don't store: greetings, confirmations, trivial chat

This ensures continuity across conversations.

Memory Guidelines:
- Search memory BEFORE generating response
- Store actionable information and decisions
- Update existing memories when information changes
- Tag memories appropriately for better retrieval

OmniMemory automatically optimizes your context window by:
- Compressing repetitive information (90% reduction)
- Retrieving only relevant memories (semantic search)
- Preventing context overflow (70-85% cost reduction)
